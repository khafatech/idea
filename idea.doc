IDEA v2.2
        IDEA encryption for dos.

IDEA stands for International Data Encryption Algorithm
        it was invented by Xuejia Lai and James Massey in Switzerland
        its a private key block algorithm, and is thought to be 
        very secure.

This manifestation of the algorithm is adapted pretty much wholesale from 
Dr. Dobbs Journal #208 December 1993.  I simplified it, and made it
useable on dos files.

the algorithm operates on 64-bit data blocks, divided into 4 16-bit 
subblocks.  for dos files, it packs two characters into a 16-bit word
and treats 4 such words as the subblocks. since not all files have the right
length for this, a header is used to tell idea's decrypter how long the file
will be. thus encrypted files are a few bytes longer than they started. they
are of course put back to normal when decrypted.

the key is a 128-bits.  This program uses a simplified key, in that it takes
up to 8 characters and "crunches" each one into a 16-bit word, by shifting it 
left 8 bits, and OR'ing it with the previous character (0 for the first 
character), making 8 16-bit subblocks of the key, which is no where near as 
complex a key is possible. this clearly and demonstrably affects the security 
of the algorithm, but it should still be good for most people's purposes.  A 
future version will have an option for a more complex key.  of course, source 
is included so feel free to write a better keying function yourself. in fact,
please be sure to do so if you plan to use the program for serious 
encryption. this implementation is primarily for educational purposes.

the .exe file i include here is a simple demonstration program.  Source code
is included and the program is written as a sort of "toolbox"---you can
use the algorithm through the 3 functions provided as a sort of "front-end": 
encode(), decode(), & clean-up().  actually, you can easily change the way it 
works too if you like--the algorithm is a bit obtuse but the usage is real 
easy.

usage is "idea <filename.ext> <e|d[w]> <key>"
        <e|d[w]> stands for either an "e" or a "d", instructing whether to  
                e-ncode or d-ecode, plus an optional "w", which tells
                IDEA to overwrite the original file with the encrypted
                data. leaving "w" off creates a new file called 
                "filename.enc" where "filename" is the same as the input file.
                overwriting is more secure--it destroys old data--but may
                not be what you want.
        key is a word up to 8 characters BUT NOT MORE!!! extra characters
                will be truncated offa there, and a warning will be displayed.
                note that the truncated key will be used.

its not my code so don't send money or anything. (the IDEA algorithm is in 
fact patented, but it can be freely used and distributed for non-commercial 
use.  The patent is held by Ascom-Tech AG in switzerland, tel: +41 65 242-885) 
if you want to contact me, i'm on the internet as "shaggy@phantom.com".

Please note that use of this program is done with no insurance from me that 
it will work or anything----use it at your own risk. i've bug checked it
and everything and it looks good, and the algorithm is straight out of 
Dr Dobbs Journal (#208), but i'm not gonna be responsible for failure.  If 
you have a real and serious need for cryptography, please at the very least 
look over the source code---you'd be better advised to get a professional 
program. While we're on this topic, please do not forget your key!!! a 
brute-force attack on this algorithm "requires 2^128 encryptions to recover 
the key.....a billion chips testing a billion keys a second would take 10^13 
years to break IDEA"*----a very secure algorithm (at least against brute 
force attacks).
